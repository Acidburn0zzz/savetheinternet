						<h2 class="heading7">You Could Pay More for Less Internet Service</h2>
						<p class="para8">
							In September 2013, the EU Commission proposed a Regulation that would allow Internet access providers to charge extra money for every online service. They call it "specialised services", and it could lead to the creation of a two-tiered internet, where only companies with deep pockets could afford  to be in the fast lane, leaving the rest of us in the dust.

					<div class="care-row-text">
						<h2 class="heading7">Internet Providers Will Decide What You Can and Can't Do Online</h2>
						<p class="para8">
							Unless the Regulation is amended, Internet providers will be able to block content without any respect for judicial oversight or the rule of law. Internet service providers should not be the police of the internet. They should not be allowed to decide what content you can and cannot access.

						<p class="para8">
							Right now information from big companies like Microsoft and Facebook are no more accessible than our Blogs or Podcasts. But if the definition of "specialised services" isn't fixed, these companies  will be in the fast lane on the data highway, leaving start-ups and  non-commercial websites like Wikipedia or governments' websites in the slow lane.

						<h2 class="heading7">Network neutrality is the Guiding Principle of the Internet</h2>
						<p class="para8">
							It is the only way of ensuring that all traffic on the internet is treated equally, regardless of its origin, recipient, sender, type of content or the means used to transmit packets. It is fundamental to ensure that the internet remains a platform for the enjoyment of human rights and innovation.
