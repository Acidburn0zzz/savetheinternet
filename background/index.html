		<h3>What is going on in the EU?</h3>
		
		
		<p>Neelie Kroes, the Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, promised to safeguard network neutrality. However, in the past few years her position has changed significantly to the opposite direction. <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=2734">Her proposal for a Regulation for a Telecom Single Market</a> confirms this. While we welcome the intention to enshrine net neutrality into law across the EU, the proposal fails to deliver the promise
        of net neutrality as it contains several problematic loopholes. However, the text itself is not far off the mark. With the right improvements, the European Union could have binding net neutrality legislation. The proposal is now in hands of the Parliament and will be reviewed by several committees, with the Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) committee as the lead in charge of this dossier. The modifications introduced in some committees have regrettably worsened the problems in the Commission proposal. Furthermore, the legislation is on a very strict timeline, as the Parliament hopes to conclude negotiations before elections in May 2014, which has made the window for consultation very small.</p>
					
		<h4 id="arguments">Arguments</h4>
		<h5>Specialised Services</h5>
		<p>Internet companies, quite reasonably, claim the right to provide
        specialised network services - such as high definition video - at guaranteed speeds for precise industrial applications. As long as these services are run separately from the internet and do not interfere with internet quality, this is clearly not a problem.</p>
		<p>Currently, the proposed Regulation does not give a clear definition of specialised services. It would allow for the possibility of a "specialised service" to be interpreted as any kind of online service. This would lead to the creation of a two-tiered internet, where certain services would be prioritised while others would be pushed into the slow lane. As a consequence, this would restrict the freedom of communication and the possibilities and incentives for innovation. (Article 2.15)</p>
		<p><b>Example:</b> Many mobile operators already offer unmetered access to Facebook, with everything else being subject to a payment based on the volume of downloaded data. If the definition of a "specialised service" allows this kind of offer, it will restrict the possible market available to potential competitors, restricting choice and innovation in the long run.</p>
		<p><b>What we need</b> is a clarification to ensure that the "service" in question is not functionally identical to an online service and that it is run on a network that is entirely separate from the public internet. The Body of European Regulators (BEREC) definition states that such services have to be separate from the public best effort internet and shall only be provided within the European electronic communications provider's network.</p>
		<h5>The "freedom" of end-users</h5>
		<p>The text proposed by the European Commission would give users the "freedom" to choose discriminatory services. This "freedom" will ultimately be negative for internet users and negative for the broader online innovative environment (Article 23).</p>
		<p><b>Example:</b> It has been estimated that British consumers alone pay approximately 5 billion pounds a year too much, due to their "freedom" to choose between numerous confusing service options.</p>
		<p><b>What we need</b> is to replace "shall be free" with "have the right" and to ensure that the text does not allow discriminatory services to be offered by internet access providers.</p>

		<h5>"Prevent or impede serious crime"</h5>
		<p>To allow the use of "reasonable traffic management measure" to "prevent or impede serious crime" will enable internet companies to interfere with online communications, without a legal basis or a court order. This provision to law enforcement activities by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) outside the rule of law which is in clear violation of article 52 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU (Article 23.5).</p>
		<p><b>Example:</b> In the UK, for example, voluntary measures are already being carried out by ISPs to prevent individuals leading to lawless blocking of a range of legal online services. In 2012, this led to the accidental blocking of the website of the French civil rights group, La Quadrature du Net.</p>
		<p><b>What we need</b> is a deletion of the dangerous exception for arbitrary interferences in communications traffic flows of reasonable traffic management.</p>

		<h4>Famous Critics</h4>

		<p>The proposed Regulation has been criticized by many different institutions and individuals. Already before the draft was publicly announced, one part of the <a href="http://edri.org/NN-negativeopinions/">European Commission criticized another</a> because they considered the proposal as a threat for net neutrality and fundamental rights.</p>

		<p>A second vocal critic is the <a href="http://berec.europa.eu/eng/document_register/subject_matter/berec/opinions/?doc=2922">Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communication</a> (BEREC). This independent expert group of national regulators helped the factual discussion about net neutrality a lot and <a href="http://berec.europa.eu/eng/document_register/subject_matter/berec/regulatory_best_practices/guidelines/1101-berec-guidelines-for-quality-of-service-in-the-scope-of-net-neutrality">came up with many useful definitions</a> (e.g. for specialised services). Furthermore, BEREC provided statistical data which showed that <a href="https://unsernetz.at/links/berec-eu-violations/">half of Europe's population is already affected by net neutrality violations in the mobile sector</a>. Also, the <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_EDPS-13-10_en.htm">European Data Protection Supervisor</a> warns about loopholes in the net neutrality provisions and highlights the danger for data privacy in the new legal situation.</p>
